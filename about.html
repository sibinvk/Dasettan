            <div class="bio-text">
                <p><strong>Dr. Kattassery Joseph Yesudas</strong> (born January 10, 1940) is an Indian playback singer and musician who sings predominantly in Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and other Indian languages. He is widely considered one of the greatest singers in the history of Indian music.</p>
                
                <p>Born in Fort Kochi, Kerala, into a Latin Catholic family, Yesudas was exposed to music from an early age through his father, Augustine Joseph, who was a well-known stage actor and singer. Recognizing his son's exceptional talent, his father provided rigorous training in Carnatic classical music.</p>
                
                <p>Yesudas's formal training under legendary Carnatic vocalist Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar in Madras (Chennai) laid the foundation for his extraordinary career. This classical grounding would become his signature, allowing him to bring unprecedented sophistication and depth to film music.</p>
                
                <p>Making his playback singing debut in 1961 with the Malayalam film "Kalpadukal," Yesudas quickly rose to become the most sought-after male playback singer in South Indian cinema. His unique ability to infuse classical purity into popular film songs revolutionized the industry.</p>
